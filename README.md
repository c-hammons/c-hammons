Hello, I am Chammons and I am a new python developer and data analyst.  
I work with python using selenium to build web scrapers and then map the results using arcGIS.
I also volunteer my time and talents to my local district of an anonymous organization.
I maintain a wordpress website and also am the administrator for google for nonprofits.
I love birds, nature and helping people.  
This is a repository of personal projects I am going to use to showcase my skills as my career progresses.
Hopefully they can also contribute to the maintanence and development of databases for twelve step programs.

With love in service,
Chammons
